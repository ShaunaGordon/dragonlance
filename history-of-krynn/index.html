<p>While every world&rsquo;s history is vast and fractured, with missing pieces and forgotten perspectives, Krynn&rsquo;s tale has been shattered by the global catastrophe called the Cataclysm. The world of Krynn was forged and destroyed, yet—broken and scarred—it continued on. Most of its people, seeking merely to survive in their slowly healing lands, care little for eons past. But the sages who piece together fragments of the past focus on three periods: before the Cataclysm, the Cataclysm itself, and the dire age since.</p>
<h2 id="before-the-cataclysm">
  Before the Cataclysm
  <a class="anchor" href="#before-the-cataclysm">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Krynn&rsquo;s earliest centuries have passed into mythohistory. The story begins in the Age of Starbirth when the gods forged the world from primordial chaos. This period&rsquo;s records are mere legends and scriptures, and few credit their details as fact.</p>
<p>Next came the Age of Dreams, a time when heroes battled the forces of evil. Many modern cultures and institutions saw their origins in this era, including the Knights of Solamnia, the Mages of High Sorcery, and the dwarven kingdom of Thorbardin. Ironically, these cultures often dismiss one another&rsquo;s foundational stories as baseless myths while fiercely insisting on the veracity of their own.</p>
<p>During a terrible conflict known as the Third Dragon War, the knight Huma Dragonbane was granted the first of the fabled <em>dragonlances</em>. He used it to defeat the evil god Takhisis the Dragon Queen and end the war, forcing the god and her dragons to leave Krynn. The good dragons of Krynn soon departed as well, leaving the world to mortals and the remaining gods.</p>
<p><img src="/images/primer/takhisis.webp" alt="Takhisis the Dragon Queen in Her Human Guise" /></p>
<p>During the thousand years before the Cataclysm, known as the Age of Might, several human nations flourished, conquering vast swaths of the continent of Ansalon in the name of good. But the triumph of the Age of Might sowed the seeds of its downfall.</p>
<p>Over the centuries, the city of Istar in eastern Ansalon grew into a continent-spanning empire, thanks in part to a military alliance with the Knights of Solamnia. Istar came to be ruled by a series of kingpriests who declared Istar the center of the world and themselves the holy messengers of the gods of good. Under their leadership, Istar declared war on actions, peoples, and even thoughts the kingpriests considered evil. Increasingly rigid and theocratic, Istar reached its apex of power just before its apocalyptic fall. The last kingpriest undertook ever more audacious magical feats, culminating in a ritual to attain godhood and rule Krynn forever in the name of good. At last, the gods acted, united in their condemnation of Istar.</p>
<h2 id="the-cataclysm">
  The Cataclysm
  <a class="anchor" href="#the-cataclysm">#</a>
</h2>
<p>As a last effort to avoid mass destruction, the gods sent the Thirteen Warnings, a series of signs meant to deter the kingpriest. Trees wept blood, fires raged unnaturally, and cyclones struck the gleaming Temple of the Kingpriest. The gods also warned a few chosen mortals, reasoning that if any of them reached Istar and prevented the ritual, the world might not be beyond redemption. But the messengers failed—the kingpriest and his followers dismissed the warnings as the work of evil and continued on their path. As the hour of the kingpriest&rsquo;s ritual to attain godhood arrived, the gods whisked away their most devout followers and unleashed punishment on all who remained.</p>
<p>A mountain of fire fell from the sky, destroying Istar. The Blood Sea—a new ocean that split eastern Ansalon—consumed the empire. Coastlines shifted all over the world, sundering nations, drowning whole regions, and stranding ports miles from the sea. Though some lands escaped the worst of the destruction, none were spared divine wrath.</p>
<p>The gods and their blessings then faded from the world, and in time, even their names were all but forgotten.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-letter" data-lang="letter">The Cataclysm! It looms larger than any other event in the history of our world, forever dividing time into before and after. Even our calendar reflects this, marking our last four chaotic centuries in years After Cataclysm (AC), while the millennia before, stretching back into shrouded myth, are Pre-Cataclysm (PC).

Many records of the time before the Cataclysm are lost to us. Those that do survive are often perplexing, referencing nations and cultures that no longer exist and geography that has changed beyond recognition.

Still, it is possible to piece these scattered sources together. At the request of the good knights of Maelgoth, here are my notes, compiling a rough introduction to the histories recorded here at the Great Library of Palanthas.

  After the Cataclysm

</h2>
<p>The Cataclysm ushered in a period of chaos. During the next three centuries, known as the Time of Darkness, cultures and ecologies were radically altered, causing famine, plague, and mass migrations. The Knights of Solamnia, the champions who might&rsquo;ve kept Ansalon united, were distrusted as former allies of Istar and persecuted across the continent, even in Solamnia.</p>
<p>The elven nations shut their borders. The dwarves of Thorbardin withdrew to their deep tunnels, refusing entrance to refugees from the surface. Many societies turned on one another or fell to disease and war. Nations of hobgoblins and ogres spread, capitalizing on humanity&rsquo;s decline and claiming whole regions. Much that survived the Cataclysm was lost in darkness.</p>
<p>At length, the worst effects of the disaster waned. Though many elves and mountain dwarves remained reclusive, other cultures tentatively rebuilt. Explorers ventured forth to map the drastically altered continent. Societies reestablished bonds of trade that united and diversified them.</p>
<p>As the civilizations of Krynn rebuilt, and new societies arose, the world learned to live with a jarring truth: the gods were truly gone. Religion on Krynn was altered forever. True clerics, who once worked miracles on behalf of their gods, had vanished. While some people remained devout, many others turned to false religions in search of answers and comfort. Some of these new faiths were founded by charlatans, others by zealots. Some claimed the names of the gods, others dismissed them entirely. In this radically changed world bereft of immortal insight, truth became subject to conjecture, even among Krynn&rsquo;s most dedicated scholars.</p>
