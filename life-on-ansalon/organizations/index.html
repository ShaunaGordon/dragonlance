<p>In eras past, when Krynn faced times of exceptional darkness, champions stepped forth from the ranks of the virtuous Knights of Solamnia and the mystical Mages of High Sorcery. These two organizations are detailed here.</p>
<h2 id="knights-of-solamnia">
  Knights of Solamnia
  <a class="anchor" href="#knights-of-solamnia">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Many celebrated heroes have risen from the Knights of Solamnia, the most storied knighthood on Ansalon. The knighthood began over a thousand years ago, during the reign of the Ergothian Empire in western Ansalon. Vinas Solamnus, head of the Ergothian imperial guard, was sent to eastern Ergoth to put down a massive rebellion. However, Solamnus learned of the rebels&rsquo; grievances and, won over to their cause, he and the rebels marched on the Ergothian capital of Daltigoth. The capital fell, and Vinas Solamnus was crowned king of a new independent nation on the eastern plains, called Solamnia in his honor.</p>
<p>King Solamnus sought above all to rule this new society justly. On the Isle of Sancrist, at a black granite stone in a secluded glade, he prayed to the gods for guidance. Three of the gods of good appeared to him: Paladine, god of justice and order; Kiri-Jolith, god of just warfare; and Habbakuk, god of nature, loyalty, and the elements. The three gods inspired three orders of knights that would guard the realm together as the Knights of Solamnia.</p>
<h3 id="tarnished-pride">
  Tarnished Pride
  <a class="anchor" href="#tarnished-pride">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Before the Cataclysm, Solamnia was a beacon of peace and prosperity. The knights established great cities and castles across the Plains of Solamnia, including Solanthus, Castle Brightblade, and Dargaard Keep. They ruled in accordance with the ideals of Vinas Solamnus, and they forged an alliance with Istar that spread those ideals across the world. The people of Solamnia attributed their prosperity to the wise and just rulership of the knights.</p>
<p>In the wake of the Cataclysm, faith in the knighthood soured to suspicion. Rumors spread that the knighthood had possessed the power to avert the Cataclysm and either failed to or chose not to—perhaps to dispense with Istar and solidify the knights&rsquo; power.</p>
<p>Most knights still tried to defend the realm as their duty demanded, but they found themselves beset on all sides, dying to protect people who rejected and persecuted them. Most fled to Sancrist Isle in the west or retreated to the protection of their strongholds and keeps, while others disguised themselves to continue their work.</p>
<p>Their power waning, the knights today are locked in a bitter internal feud: Is it better to maintain their strict codes even in the face of obsolescence, secure in the knowledge they were true to themselves? Or should they embrace a changing world and fight to defend it, even if the knights must change with it?</p>
<h3 id="the-oath-and-the-measure">
  The Oath and the Measure
  <a class="anchor" href="#the-oath-and-the-measure">#</a>
</h3>
<img src="/images/primer/knights-solamnia.webp" style="max-height:800px;display:inline-block" />
<div class="note left ">
<p>Emblems Top to Bottom:</p>
<ul>
<li>Order of the Crown</li>
<li>Order of the Rose</li>
<li>Order of the Sword</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>The Knights of Solamnia follow a chivalric code with two parts: the Oath and the Measure, both inspired by the writings of Vinas Solamnus. The Oath is simple and aspirational—a star to navigate by—while the Measure lays out specific rules for the organization and conduct of the knighthood.</p>
<p><em><strong>The Oath.</strong></em> The Oath of the Knights of Solamnia has been the same since Vinas Solamnus founded the knighthood: &ldquo;Est Sularus oth Mithas,&rdquo; or &ldquo;My Honor Is My Life.&rdquo; This principle—to sacrifice all for the sake of honor—guides the actions of every knight, at least in theory.</p>
<p><em><strong>The Measure.</strong></em> In contrast to the Oath, the Measure is a staggeringly complicated, excruciatingly specific guide to knightly life. Originally put forth by Vinas Solamnus as an organizational scheme and code of conduct for the knightly orders, the Measure grew over the years to encompass thirty-seven volumes, covering everything from courtly etiquette to the proper saddling of mounts. According to the Measure, the knights no longer have sufficient numbers to elect a new Grand Master, the highest office in the knighthood, leaving them without an authority who could overrule or update the Measure.</p>
<p>Despite this, a growing minority of knights push for a reform of the Measure, believing that it&rsquo;s unwieldy and outdated and that it no longer serves the ideals laid down by their founder.</p>
<h3 id="knightly-orders">
  Knightly Orders
  <a class="anchor" href="#knightly-orders">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Each Solamnic knight belongs to one of three orders. Each order, led by a High Knight elected from among its number, has its own hierarchy and rules for admission.</p>
<p><em><strong>Knights of the Crown.</strong></em> Most knights begin their journey as squires in the Knights of the Crown, who honor the god Habbakuk as their patron. The order emphasizes ideals of loyalty and obedience that serve as a bedrock whether a knight chooses to remain within the order or move beyond it. Knights of the Crown are expected to aid any knight who requires assistance and any kingdom on the List of Loyalty, the official roll of the Knights&rsquo; allies.</p>
<p><em><strong>Knights of the Sword.</strong></em> Dedicated to heroic honor, courage, and reverence for the true gods, this order upholds the virtues of Kiri-Jolith, the god of just war. Members dedicate themselves to courageous sacrifice, pledging to defend the defenseless without regard for the knights&rsquo; personal suffering. Knights who join this order often undertake a heroic quest to prove their worth.</p>
<p><em><strong>Knights of the Rose.</strong></em> Guided by the god Paladine, the Knights of the Rose exemplify honor tempered by wisdom and justice. Before joining their ranks, most knights rise within the Knights of the Sword after serving with the Knights of the Crown. Those who prove both their loyalty and courage are fit to join this order, which upholds the knighthood&rsquo;s highest ideals.</p>
<h2 id="mages-of-high-sorcery">
  Mages of High Sorcery
  <a class="anchor" href="#mages-of-high-sorcery">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Many magic-users on Krynn are members of an ancient organization known as the Mages of High Sorcery. Predominantly composed of wizards—with a lesser number of sorcerers, warlocks, and other spellcasters—members are divided into three orders. Each order dedicates itself to virtues extolled by a god of magic and honors the moon its deity is associated with. The three orders cooperate as part of a single organization, overseen by a council of experienced members known as the Conclave.</p>
<p>Equally devoted to the study of magic and united in defending their knowledge and traditions, the three orders differ in their fundamental reasons for using magic.</p>
<h3 id="order-of-the-white-robes">
  Order of the White Robes
  <a class="anchor" href="#order-of-the-white-robes">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Dedicated to the good god Solinari, the White Robes accept the solemn responsibility of using magic only to make the world a better place. The path they walk is a narrow one, and almost daily, a mage of the White Robes faces the agonizing decision of whether to intervene in the affairs of others for the greater good.</p>
<h3 id="order-of-the-red-robes">
  Order of the Red Robes
  <a class="anchor" href="#order-of-the-red-robes">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Inspired by the neutral god Lunitari, the Red Robes help others when it suits them and use their gifts for their own enrichment as they desire. Mages of the Red Robes are expected to wield their power responsibly, represent their order faithfully, and uphold the balance between good and evil in their own actions and the world at large.</p>
<h3 id="order-of-the-black-robes">
  Order of the Black Robes
  <a class="anchor" href="#order-of-the-black-robes">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Often reviled and feared in equal measure, the Black Robes follow the example of the evil god Nuitari, the black moon of Krynn. A mage of the Black Robes is expected to first further their own ambitions, then pursue the goals of their order, and then support the continued well-being of the Conclave.</p>
<h3 id="towers-of-high-sorcery">
  Towers of High Sorcery
  <a class="anchor" href="#towers-of-high-sorcery">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Thousands of years ago, the Mages of High Sorcery cooperated to build five Towers of High Sorcery, centers of learning to advance the craft of magic and the interests of the orders. Three of the towers were destroyed during the Cataclysm, and a fourth—the once unsurpassed Tower of Palanthas—lies cursed and empty. The only tower remaining in operation, the Tower of Wayreth, now serves as headquarters of the Mages of High Sorcery and repository of their greatest secrets.</p>
<h3 id="the-test-of-high-sorcery">
  The Test of High Sorcery
  <a class="anchor" href="#the-test-of-high-sorcery">#</a>
</h3>
<p>An apprentice mage who seeks to join one of the three orders must first pass a trial known as the Test of High Sorcery. Every mage&rsquo;s test is different, tailored to both the order they wish to join and their own personal challenges and aspirations. Nonetheless, a few elements are always present.</p>
<p><em><strong>Lethal Failure.</strong></em> The primary purpose of the test is to weed out those who would misuse magic. Every test is designed so failure means death. There is no judge, no score, and little chance of surviving a failed test.</p>
<p><em><strong>Magical Acumen.</strong></em> A mage must wield magic with competence, creativity, and control. Every test requires a mage to use the most advanced magic they&rsquo;ve learned—and, sometimes, to push beyond it.</p>
<p><em><strong>Test of Character.</strong></em> The mages of the Conclave need to know the apprentice will honor the laws of their order, no matter the circumstance. To this end, the test confronts an apprentice with bitter moral and emotional choices as well as magical challenges.</p>
<p><em><strong>Illusion and Reality.</strong></em> Friends, enemies, and loved ones might appear in the test, along with all manner of hazards and puzzles. The applicant has no way of knowing which challenges are illusory and which are real. In some cases, the test has lasting consequences for an applicant&rsquo;s life beyond the order.</p>
<h3 id="renegade-mages">
  Renegade Mages
  <a class="anchor" href="#renegade-mages">#</a>
</h3>
<p>If a spellcaster leaves or is thrown out of the Mages of High Sorcery, or they fail the Test of High Sorcery and survive, the organization&rsquo;s leaders forbid them from continuing to practice magic. Mages who practice magic in defiance of the Conclave are deemed renegades. Members of the robed orders are duty-bound to report and oppose such renegades. Some order members hunt renegades, seeking to punish or slay those who&rsquo;ve defied the Mages of High Sorcery.</p>
