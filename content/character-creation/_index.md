# Character Creation

As the mysterious forces march across Krynn and threaten all of its peoples, heroic souls rise to defy them. Forged in the crucible of war, these remarkable few are all that stand between the peace-loving peoples of Krynn and an age of oppression.

**DM's Note:** This is a heroic campaign. As such, your character should be...well...heroic. They don't have to be capital-G Good, but they should be a decent person, with an interest in saving others and the world at large.

You are one of those heroes, called to service because of your history in the company of adventurer Ispin Greenshield prior to his retirement to the Solamnic town of Vogler. As you create your character, think about how you knew him. Here are some ideas (but feel free to come up with something else):

##### Meeting Ispin Greenshield
|  d6 | Experience                                                                                                               |
|:---:|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | Ispin was a close friend of one of your parents. You've known him since you were a child.                                |
|  2  | You and Ispin defended a community from a notorious band of goblin raiders.                                              |
|  3  | Ispin tracked you down to return something precious that a thief stole.                                                  |
|  4  | Ispin visited your homeland, bringing with him goods and stories from far-off lands. He taught you much about the world. |
|  5  | Ispin spent a season with your family and taught you swordplay, sailing, a language, or another skill.                   |
|  6  | You and Ispin once competed for the same person's affections, only to discover each other's friendship.                  |

Additionally, you know the following about him:

- Ispin was a good-natured human adventurer from Solamnia.
- Ispin took his name from a distinctive green shield he found early in his adventuring career. He claimed the shield was magical, but it had no obvious magical properties.
- The bighearted Ispin loved telling tall tales of his travels to anyone who would listen.
- Ispin used to adventure with a human Knight of Solamnia named Becklin and a hill dwarf warrior named Cudgel. These two featured in many of Ispin's stories of fighting sea monsters and goblin raiders.
- Ispin retired from traveling years ago, becoming a permanent resident of a little-known village in Solamnia called Vogler.

## Creating Your Character

Character creation works a little differently this time around. Here's an outline of the steps:

1. Select your race (be mindful of the race notes in this primer)
2. Select your class
3. Select your background (again, be mindful of the notes)
4. If your background does not come with a feat, select a feat from the 1st Level Feats list
5. Roll for your stats -- we will do this one together
