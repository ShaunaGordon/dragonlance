# Backgrounds

This campaign introduces two unique backgrounds: Knight of Solamnia and Mage of High Sorcery. Be sure to check them out and see if you want to use one.

## Disallowed Backgrounds

Most backgrounds can be made to work, even if they're oddball ones. However, there are a few that are just too out of place to be worth trying to fit in here. These ones are disallowed, no negotiations:

- All Strixhaven backgrounds
- All Astral Adventurer's Guide backgrounds
- All Wild Beyond the Witchlight backgrounds
