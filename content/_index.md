# War Comes to Krynn

The world has ended, and it's ending again.

Three hundred years ago, the Cataclysm brought ruin to the world of Krynn. In a single day, an age of wonders came to an end. Countless innocents died, the face of the world was reshaped, and the gods themselves faded into legend. Through ages of struggle, the peoples of Krynn survived, but the world isn't what it was. Those nations that remain linger in the shadows of their ancestors' wonders. Only slowly have they begun to push back centuries of darkness and rediscover how the world has changed.

Now, war has come, led by a mysterious army seemingly straight from legend. Already, regions fall to this new threat -- a threat big enough for some, even, to turn to the all but forgotten gods as a wounded world hangs in the balance.

To the Council of Maelgoth:

War is coming—that truth I can no longer deny. Here in Solamnia's eastern reaches, rumors swirl of human-led armies on the march, their ranks swelled by hobgoblins, minotaurs, ogres, and mysterious hooded mercenaries, all seeking a share of the spoils. Our allies in Nordmaar have fallen silent, and desperate travelers say the people of Khur have joined the enemy en masse. Whispers also speak of winged doom, wild reports of riders on dragonnels—and I dare imagine worse.

I don't yet understand the shape of our enemy. Their motivations, their origins, and their very nature remain opaque. What is clear is that we face a threat unlike any since the Cataclysm. And when it comes, it will come for Kalaman.

Good lieges, I pray you make overtures toward healing the old wounds between our order and the Beacon of the East. If we knights are to meet this threat, we need the sharp eyes and strong shields of Kalaman as allies.

To aid your efforts, I have compiled my notes on the Kalaman region's history, neighbors, and lore. I hope this knowledge proves useful in meeting the threat before us.

Live with honor,
Becklin Uth Viharin, Knight of the Crown
