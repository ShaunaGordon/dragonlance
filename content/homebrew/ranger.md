# Ranger Modifications

## Subclass: Hunter

### 6th Level: Hunter's Lore

*Replaces Defensive Tactics*

You	can	call	on	the	forces	of	nature	to	reveal certain	strengths	and	weaknesses	of	your	prey. While	a	creature	is	marked	by	your	Hunterâ€™s	Mark,	you	know	whether	that	creature	has	any	Immunities,	Resistances,	and	Vulnerabilities,	and	if	the	creature	has	any,	you	know	what	they	are.
