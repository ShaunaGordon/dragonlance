# Travel and Environment Related Resources

Many travel-related things are tedious or kind of nonsensical, so these are our rules for traveling and the resources related to traveling or environment (rations, ammo, etc).

Generally speaking, we only track resources in situations where the raw materials are limited. For example, tracking arrows is only necessary in environments where wood and appropriate-sized rocks are rare, such as in a dungeon or desert. In places where the resources are abundant, such as a forest, we assume competency on the part of the wielder to make more of their own ammunition and to spend their downtime doing so.

## Rations

Rations will be tracked in places where adequate food is scarce, or the available food options are not suitable for consumption by all party members, such as dungeons, deserts, or underwater.

If the party has a character whose first-level class is a Ranger (not a character that started as another class and then multiclassed into it), has the Outlander background, or has expertise in Survival (*not* just proficiency), the party automatically finds sufficient food to not use rations while in a food-abundant environment. In less than abundant environments, these characters have advantage on rolls to find food, and can attempt to find food even in barren environments.

Parties with a member that is proficient in Survival have advantage on rolls to find food in abundant environments, and can attempt to find food in less than abundant environments, and attempt to find food in barren environments at disadvantage.

Food can be found in any amount from nothing to enough to feed the full party. Any amount less than feeding the full party will be subtracted from the rations supply.

## Ammo and Consumable Weapons

Ammo and consumable weapons that can be reasonably crafted in the field (arrows, spears, sling "bullets", etc) do not need to be tracked in raw material-abundant environments as long as the wielder is proficient with the weapon in question, do not need to be tracked, and are considered to have a sufficient supply for a typical day.

Mundane ammo that cannot be crafted, but can be readily retrieved and don't fly far (axes, daggers, etc) can be retrieved without issue, unless otherwise stated.

Ammo that cannot be crafted with just field materials and cannot be retrieved (namely, firearm bullets) can be purchased or crafted in town in bulk, or field craft kits (with crafting limits) can be purchased, sufficient for several days' worth of travel, and tracked by the day.

All field-crafted ammo is mundane and magical ammo cannot be field-crafted. Craftable magical ammo can only be crafted in town.
