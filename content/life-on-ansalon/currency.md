# Currency

Since the Cataclysm, the harsh realities of daily survival leave little room for impracticality. For years after the devastation, steel's value skyrocketed until it was valued as highly as gold, thanks to the difficulty of forging steel and its obvious practical applications. Similarly, bronze was valued on par with silver. While the value of steel and bronze has diminished to pre-Cataclysm standards, trade coins of bronze and steel remain in use across Ansalon.
