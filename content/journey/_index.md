# The Journey So Far

The party has joined together and found your way to [Vogler](/journey/vogler), where you've explored some of what the city has to offer in the hours before Ispin's funeral.

## The Green Shield and the Final Farewell

The funeral for Ispin has been held, and many people shared stories about Ispin. Some were thrilling, and others touching and heartfelt. But all showed the love everyone had for him.

Everyone, of course, except for Bakaris the Younger, who was...in a word...rude. The party confronts him, which ultimately drives him off, but...not before Tobin, in his infinite wisdom, whips a shotglass at him. This, naturally, gets him arrested and thrown in jail for the night.

While Tobin dries out behind bars, the others find a mysterious figure in the corner. She seems too melancholy for how Ispin wanted his funeral, but she's polite enough, and introduces herself as **Leedara**.

**Cudgel**, too, introduces herself when the rest of the party is free, and invites them visit her mercenary band outside of town.

## Battle of High Hill

Every year, as part of the Kingfisher Festival, Vogler does a re-enactment of the [Battle of High Hill](/maps#high-hill).

Thanks to Tobin's crime of assaulting Bakaris the Younger, he now *must* participate in the re-enactment. However, the rest of the party has willingly volunteered to participate.
